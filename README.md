An AutoHotkey script that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to paraphrase text. It copies content from the clipboard, encodes it for command line use, and passes it to a Python script (paraphrase.py). The script requests the OpenAI API for paraphrasing and returns the result, which is then sent as keystrokes by the AutoHotkey script.
